1, When you open this application, it shows your current location on the Google map. And the information div shows the current address with formatted address, local time and timestamp. The input frame shows your current address, too.


2, You can drag the map to choose the destination via a click. The map will pan and set your destination in the center of Google map. The information div shows the destination address with formatted address, local time and timestamp. The input frame shows your current destination, too.


3, You can input the address manually to search your destination. I added ngx-google-places autocomplete ability for the input. So, it is easy to use this input research. After your input, the map will pan to your inputted destination. And the information div and input frame will show your inputted destinationâ€™s information, too.


4, I use Bootstrap for page design. So, the page will be changed automatically when you change the screen size or use different devices.


5, I added few Angular animations for input frame and the div of information.
